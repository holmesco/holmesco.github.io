**Abstract**: Low frequency dynamics introduced by structural flexibility can result in considerable performance degradation and even instability in on-orbit, robotic manipulators. Although there is a wealth of literature that addresses this problem, the author has found that many advanced solutions are often precluded by practical considerations. On the other hand, classical, robust control methods are tractable for these systems if the design problem is properly constrained. This paper investigates a pragmatic engineering approach that evaluates the system&apos;s stability margins in the face of uncertain, flexible perturbation dynamics with frequencies that lie close to or within the bandwidth of the nominal closed-loop system. The robustness of classical control strategies is studied in the context of both collocated (joint rate) and non-collocated (force/torque and vision-based) feedback. It is shown that robust stability and performance depend on the open-loop control bandwidth of the nominal control law (as designed for a simplified, rigid plant). Namely, the designed bandwidth must be constrained to be lower than the minimum flexible mode frequency of the unmodeled dynamics by a given factor. This strategy gives credence to popular heuristic methods commonly used to reduce the effect of unmodeled dynamics in complex manipulator systems.
