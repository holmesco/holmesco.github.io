I am a PhD candidate studying at the [University of Toronto Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/) at [ASRL](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/) with Tim Barfoot.  Broadly speaking, my research goals involve bringing advanced theoretical tools to bear on the pressing challenges of robotics. To date, my research has focused on the application of *convex relaxations* to key problems in robotic state-estimation in order to certify correctness of solutions. 

From Speed To Safety in Robotics
======

The field of robotics is one that has always been full of practical challenges. By far, one of the greatest hurdles that every roboticist faces is that of designing algorithms that can be deployed for *realtime* operation. There is a tacit expectation in the robotics community and -- perhaps more importantly -- in broader society that robots *should* be able to perform tasks as fast as any human (or animal) can. This expectation has pushed the field to produce incredibly efficient methods, but it has also led to reliance on algorithms that prioritize speed rather than safety.

In particular, almost all robots rely on *local optimization methods* to perform most of their tasks, from state estimation to motion planning to control execution. Though these methods have become very fast over the past decades, it is well known that they have one crucial flaw: if these methods are not initialized well, they can produce solutions that are completely incorrect. What is worse, a robot that is using these methods will remain completely unaware of their failure. 

Background
======

Before starting my PhD in 2021, I worked for 5 years at [MacDonald Detwiller and Associates (MDA)](https://mda.space/en/) as a Controls/Systems Engineer in the Guidance Navagation and Controls Department. In 2016, I completed a Master's in Applied Science at the University of Toronto Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, studying *patterned linear control* with [Mireille Broucke](https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~broucke/). I completed my undergraduate degree in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto in 2014.
