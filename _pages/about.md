I am a PhD candidate studying at the [University of Toronto Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/) at [ASRL](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/) with Tim Barfoot.  Broadly speaking, my research goals involve bringing advanced theoretical tools to bear on the pressing challenges of robotics. Namely, my interests lie in the areas of **nonlinear and convex optimization** and how they can be applied to **robustly and efficiently** solve robotics problems. 

To date, my research has focused on the development of  **certifiably correct** algorithms that solve key problems in robotics (particularly in state-estimation). These algorithms leverage *convex relaxations* in order to either globally solve a given problem or verifiy correctness of a given solution. More recently, I have been looking at how certifiable algorithms can be applied to **optimization layers** that are embedded in deep-learning networks.

Background
======

Before starting my PhD in 2021, I worked for 5 years at [MacDonald Detwiller and Associates (MDA)](https://mda.space/en/) as a Controls/Systems Engineer working on orbital manipulators. In 2016, I completed a Master's in Applied Science at the University of Toronto Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, studying *patterned linear control* with [Mireille Broucke](https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~broucke/). I completed my undergraduate degree in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto in 2014.
